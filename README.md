## Generators in Python

Generators in Python are a powerful and memory-efficient way to create iterators. They allow you to generate a sequence of values over time, rather than computing them all at once and storing them in memory. This makes generators particularly useful when working with large datasets or infinite sequences.

Key features of generators:

1. **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators produce values on-demand, one at a time, only when requested. This is in contrast to creating a list of all values upfront.

2. **Memory Efficiency**: Since values are generated one at a time, generators use less memory compared to creating and storing an entire sequence in memory.

3. **Infinite Sequences**: Generators can represent infinite sequences, which is not possible with regular lists or tuples.

4. **Simple Syntax**: Generators can be created using functions with the `yield` keyword or generator expressions.

### Creating Generators

There are two main ways to create generators in Python:

1. **Generator Functions**: These are functions that use the `yield` keyword instead of `return`. When called, they return a generator object.

   Example:
   ```python
   def count_up_to(n):
       i = 1
       while i <= n:
           yield i
           i += 1

   # Using the generator
   for num in count_up_to(5):
       print(num)
   ```

2. **Generator Expressions**: These are similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses instead of square brackets.

   Example:
   ```python
   squares = (x**2 for x in range(10))
   ```

### Benefits of Using Generators

- **Memory Efficiency**: Ideal for working with large datasets that don't fit into memory.
- **Improved Performance**: Can start producing values immediately, without waiting for the entire sequence to be generated.
- **Code Readability**: Can lead to cleaner, more readable code, especially for complex iterations.

In this project, we use generators in the `lazy_file_reader` function to efficiently process large CSV files without loading the entire file into memory at once.


## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of generators and lazy evaluation techniques to efficiently process large CSV files. The main components of the project are implemented in the `session12.py` file. Let's break down the key elements:

### 1. `type_checked_line` Function

This function performs type-checking and conversion for each line of data according to the annotations of a namedtuple.

- **Input**: A namedtuple class, a list of values, and a line number.
- **Output**: An instance of the namedtuple if successful, or None if there's an error.
- **Key Feature**: Converts string values to appropriate types (e.g., datetime) based on namedtuple annotations.

### 2. `lazy_file_reader` Function

This generator function reads a file lazily, yielding type-checked namedtuple instances for each line.

- **Input**: File path as a string.
- **Output**: Yields type-checked namedtuple instances.
- **Key Features**:
  - Reads the file line by line, conserving memory.
  - Uses `type_checked_line` for data validation and conversion.
  - Defines a namedtuple structure based on the CSV headers.

### 3. `LazyIterable` Class

This class provides an iterator interface to read a file lazily.

- **Input**: File path as a string.
- **Output**: An iterable object that yields type-checked namedtuple instances.
- **Key Feature**: Encapsulates the `lazy_file_reader` function in a class, providing a reusable iterable interface.

### 4. `count_violations` Function

This function counts the number of violations for each vehicle make in the file.

- **Input**: An instance of `LazyIterable`.
- **Output**: A dictionary with vehicle makes as keys and violation counts as values.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses the `LazyIterable` to process the file efficiently.
  - Demonstrates how to use the lazy evaluation approach for data analysis.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Memory Efficiency**: The lazy evaluation technique allows processing of large files without loading them entirely into memory.
2. **Flexibility**: The type-checking mechanism allows for easy handling of different data types and formats.
3. **Reusability**: The `LazyIterable` class provides a reusable interface for lazy file processing.
4. **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling to manage issues with data formatting or type conversion.

This implementation showcases how generators and lazy evaluation can be used to create efficient, memory-friendly data processing pipelines, particularly useful for handling large datasets.
